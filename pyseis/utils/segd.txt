Introduction 
For several years now there has been talk of the need for a new revision of the SEG-D standard for seismic field data.  The 
last revision of the standard, Rev 2.0, was published in 1996, and in the intervening decade there have been significant 
developments in acquisition and computer technologies, and a new revision would bring the standard into line with current 
industry techniques and practices. 
At the SEG convention in Denver in 2004, the SEG Technical Standards Committee decided to revive the SEGD Format 
Subcommittee, with Jill Lewis of Troika International volunteering to chair the subcommittee and provide the necessary 
energy to drive it forward.  Since then there has been considerable behind the scenes activity to ascertain what should be 
contained in the new revision, culminating in meetings of interested parties at the EAGE in Madrid and the SEG in 
Houston in 2005. 
The following individuals have been active participants in this effort:

Numerous other people have also participated at various times. 
To begin with there was considerable discussion as to whether a new revision of the SEG-D standard is what is actually 
required, or whether the time has come develop a completely new format, SEG-E perhaps.  After all the SEG-D standard is 
now thirty years old, and while it has gone through several revisions to maintain its utility as the industry has evolved, 
there comes a time when a format has been coerced as far as it can go, and ultimately it is appropriate to start again from 
scratch.  However it was felt that developing a new format would be a major effort which could be undertaken in the 
longer term, but at least one more revision of the SEG-D standard should be produced to address the issues that are 
concerning people today.  Hopefully this revision could be produced fairly quickly. 
One of the main driving forces behind a revision to the SEG-D standard at this time is the advent of what might be 
considered very high capacity tape devices.  Of particular significance in the seismic industry is the IBM 3592 with a 
capacity of 300 Gbytes, and higher capacities promised to follow quickly behind.  Traditionally a tape cartridge would 
only contain data from a single seismic line, but with these high capacities this has become an unreasonable restriction, and 
a way had to be found to uniquely identify SEG-D records from different lines on the same cartridge. 
Inevitably in an exercise such as this there has been a diversity of views on what should be included in the revision, boiling 
down to a conflict between completeness and compatibility.  Obviously there is a desire to make the new revision as 
complete as possible, providing facilities for recording the variety of attribute values and the multiplicity of channels that a 
modern acquisition system makes available.  However many attributes were simply not envisaged when the format was 
first defined, and finding a place for them would require significant structural changes to the format.  For instance it is 
being proposed that the size of a Channel Set Descriptor, currently 32 bytes, should be increased to 64 or 96 bytes.  Many 
felt that this would be a change too far, requiring extensive modifications to SEG-D reading software which in some cases 
might not be easy, or even possible, to make.  In particular there are widely used software packages for QC that are not

being actively maintained any more.  However some of the more extensive changes being proposed are definitely required 
to solve real problems, and they must be accommodated somehow in a format revision. 
In order to address the conflicting concerns of the interested parties, it was decided that the revision should be 
implemented in two stages.  This is the first of those stages, Rev 2.1,  which is a relatively minor revision implementing 
some changes that everyone agrees are required, particularly the usage of very high capacity media, while maintaining 
substantial downward compatibility with Rev 2.0.  Many of the issues being addressed by Rev 2.1 have been raised by 
users of the SPS processing support format, and a minor revision of the SPS standard is being produced in parallel.  In the 
meantime work continues on a more extensive revision, Rev 3, which will require a substantial amount of work.  
Nevertheless, it is envisaged that SEG-D Rev 3 will follow less than a year behind Rev 2.1.

2.0 Changes Introduced in Revision 2.1 
The following list discusses each of the specific changes made in Revision 2.1 compared to Revision 2.0. 
1. Revision number changed from 2.0 to 2.1, see 
-  Chapter 4, field number 2  
-  Chapter 8.2 (General Header # 2, byte 11 and 12). 
2. Since Rev 2.1 is intended to handle ultra high density tapes, acceptable media is expanded to include:  
  STK 9940B, IBM 3592 (Jaguar-1) and IBM TS1120 (Jaguar-2).  
     For further details, see Appendix F. 
3. Field file number not changed (same as previous revision), range is 0-16.777.215 
4. More than one production line per tape is allowed, as long as a unique combination of field file number and line 
sequence number are used per storage unit. 
Sequence number is added, see General Header # 2, byte 21-22. Range is 1-65535 (Set to 0 if not valid).  
5. Appendix C is updated (API Producer Organization Codes). Organization codes are now assigned by Energistics, 
which maintains the current list of codes (API in previous revision). 
6. Appendix A is updated (Manufacturers of Seismic Field Recorders). 
7. Producer organization code is no longer a required field (Chapter 4, field number).

2.1 Changes Introduced in Rev 2.0 
The following list discusses each of the specific changes made in Revision 2.0 compared to Revision 1.0. Also 
mentioned are changes which were discussed as potential changes to be included in Rev 2.0, but were not included in 
Rev 2.0. 
1. 
Since Rev 2.0 is intended to handle higher density tapes, acceptable media is expanded to include: 3490/3490E, 
3590, D2, and D3. 
2. 
It is not anticipated that the higher density drives will be used to record multiplexed data. Rev 2.0 does not 
support multiplexed data. 
3. 
No specific changes will be made to SEG-D to handle “non-shot domain” data. Either a new committee should 
be formed, or the charter of this committee should be extended to develop a new format for this application. It 
does not appear practical to extend SEG-D to fit this application. 
4. 
No special arrangements will be made to provide a standard method of recording SPS in the SEG-D header. The 
relevant portions of SPS can be put into existing header extensions in user defined positions. 
5. 
The MP factor description will be modified to clarify the meaning for fixed bit data (see MP discussion in 
section 7). 
6. 
The description of byte 12 in the General Header is being clarified to clearly state that the byte defines the 
number of additional blocks. Figure 4 in the SEG-D Rev 1 document will be changed from # BLKS IN GEN 
HDR to “# Additional blks in Gen Hdr”. Another correction will be made to correctly state, for byte 1 of the 
General Header, “File number of four digits (0-9999) set to FFFF (Hex) when the file number is greater than 
9999. 
7. 
The RECEIVER LINE NUMBER (bytes 1-3) and RECEIVER POINT NUMBER (Bytes 4-6) in the Trace 
Header Extension have been modified to include a fractional component. An all one’s pattern (FFFFFF Hex) in 
either of these fields, will serve as a flag to indicate that the complete five byte value will be located in newly 
defined locations in the Trace Header Extension. See Trace Header Extension table below. 
8. 
The maximum number of Trace Header Extensions is now limited to 15. 
9. 
Channels within the same Channel Set must now have the same number of Trace Header Extensions. Since all 
traces within a Channel Set will now contain the same number of Trace Header Extensions, the number of Trace 
Header Extensions will be indicated in the Channel Set Descriptor. The previously unused nibble of Byte 29 in 
the Channel Set Descriptor will now be defined to be a 4 bit binary parameter that defines the number of Trace 
Header Extensions for that Channel Set. Byte 29 of the Channel Set descriptor will now be: 
0 
1 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 
7 
EFH3 
EFH2 
EFH1 
EFH0 
THE3 
THE
2 
THE1 
THE0 
As a result of this limitation the Trace Header Extension field in Byte 10 of the Trace Header will also be 
redefined as a 4 bit value limited to a maximum of 15 Trace Header Extensions.  
10. 
The length of each trace within a Channel Set is now restricted to be the same value. This limitation and the 
restricting the number of Trace Header Extensions to the same number within a Channel Set will result in each 
trace within a Channel Set being recorded with the same number of bytes. 
11. 
A tape label will be required on each tape. The details of this label format are described in section 4. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Page 7:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7         
12. 
Data may be recorded in large logical blocks to maximize the transfer rates with high density tape systems. 3 
types of device structures are supported: 
A) 
Variable block length devices. 
Every shot record must be aligned on a block boundary (i.e. each block will contain data from only one shot 
record).  Multiple channel sets may be included in each block. When the data to be recorded in a block contains 
less than the maximum number of bytes in the block, there will be no padding characters to fill the block. 
Storage Unit Structure in field 3 in Storage Unit Label must contain the text “RECORD” 
B) 
Byte stream devices 
There is no concept of a block, even though there is a hidden underlying physical block structure. Within each 
file, one or more shot records are written consecutively without any gap. 
Storage Unit Structure in field 3 in Storage Unit Label must contain the text “RECORD” 
C) 
Fixed block length devices 
Every shot record must be aligned on a block boundary (i.e. each block will contain data from only one shot 
record).  Multiple channel sets may be included in each block. Typically the last block in a shot record will 
contain less data than the block size, the remaining part of this block will be padded with characters without any 
information. 
Storage Unit Structure in field 3 in Storage Unit Label must contain the text “FIXREC” and the block size is 
found in field 5 in Storage Unit Label. 
Note:  Structure A can be mapped to a file directly but one can not re-generate the same interblock gaps and File 
Marks from data stored on a file. Structure B and C can be mapped to a file directly and the structure can be re-
generated apart from the original position of the File Marks. 
13. 
An appendix will be added to indicate the maximum allowable block size for accepted types of media. It is 
expected that this table will need to be updated approximately once per year. 
14. 
Byte 12 of the Trace Header will have an additional option, TR= 03 Trace has been edited. This parameter will 
indicate the acquisition system has modified one or more samples of this trace. During data acquisition, if a 
telemetry error occurs, a sample may be corrupted. Some radio acquisition systems fill in this missing data with a 
copy of the previous sample, or interpolate to fill in the missing sample.  Trace edit can also occur when a noise 
edit process is applied by the acquisition system. The TR=03 flag should be set for those traces which have been 
modified by the acquisition system.  
15. 
The SEG-D, Rev 2.0 format treats data going to tape as a byte stream. File Marks are not required to separate 
shot records, however File Marks may be included in between shot records where appropriate to ease error 
recovery and/or to provide logical partitioning of the data. If used, File Marks may only be recorded at shot 
record boundaries.  For field tapes, File Marks should be written as frequently as possible, preferably for every 
shot.  If data is staged on disk, many shots can be stored in each file.  When SEG-D, Rev 2.0 data is recorded on 
tape, an EOD mark must be recorded after the last valid record and prior to the end of tape 
16. 
The time standard referenced by byte 14 of the General Header has been changed from GMT to UTC. 
17. 
Partitioning of a tape or other type media volume is now allowed.  Each partition, or each tape if not partitioned, 
constitutes one storage unit.  The storage unit label shall consist of the first 128 bytes of the first user-writable 
tape record in the first user-writable physical block and may, optionally, be followed by an File Mark.  No File 
Mark shall be written before the storage unit label. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

18. 
Added a field in the Trace Header extension to indicate the type of sensor used for that trace (Byte 21). 
2.2 Changes Introduced in Rev 1 
In 1994, several changes were introduced to SEG-D to increase flexibility. These changes are listed below. 
1. 
To allow for additional defined fields in SEG-D headers, additional blocks are allowed for the General Header and 
Demux Trace Header.   
2. 
Added provision for an optional set of General Trailer blocks.  This type header allows provisions for recording 
auxiliary seismic system and real-time navigation related data in the trailer.  The trailer is optional and typically 
follows all other recorded data. 
The addition of the trailer will allow the accumulation of system faults, data QC information, real-time navigation 
position, and timing information on the same tape, and contiguous with, the shotpoint that it relates to.  By recording 
this data after all of the other data, additional time is provided for collecting the data and transferring it to the 
recording system. 
The Trailer blocks take the same general form as the Channel Set Descriptor.  Byte 11 uses the "Channel Type 
Identification" set to 1100 to indicate a Trailer block.  Bytes 1 and 2 indicate the number of the General Trailer 
block, with the first block numbered as 1. 
All other information in the trailer is optional and may be formatted as desired by the manufacturer/user. 
The number of General Trailer blocks is indicated in bytes 13 and 14 of General Header Block #2. 
3. 
Provide provision to include the revision of SEG-D format. Added to Bytes 11 and 12 of General Header Block #2 
contain the SEG-D Revision Number.  The revision number is a 16 bit unsigned binary number.  The Revision 
number is 1 for the proposed version. 
In addition, in the General Header Block #1, nibble 1 of byte 12 contains the number of additional blocks in the 
general header.  Nibble 1, byte 12 is an unsigned binary number.  This number will be 1 or greater for SEG D Rev 1. 
4.  
Added provision to include the source and receiver locations for each source and receiver location.  Source locations 
are included in the General Header Blocks.  Block #3 contains the position for Source Set #1.  Additional General 
Header Blocks may be included to allow for additional Source Sets. 
Source positions are defined by a Source Line Number (three bytes integer and two bytes fraction), a Source Point 
Number (three bytes integer and two bytes fraction), and a Source Point Index (one byte).  This index allows several 
locations for the source in the grid, the original value is 1 and that value is incremented by 1 every time the source is 
moved, even when it is moved back to a previous location). 
Receiver locations are included in Trace Header Extensions to be used with Demux Trace Headers.  Receiver 
positions are defined by a Receiver Line Number (three integer bytes and two fraction bytes), a Receiver Point 
Number (three bytes integer and two bytes fraction), and a Receiver Point Index (one byte).  This index allows for 
defining the receiver group in the grid, the original value is 1 and that value is incremented by 1 every time the 
receiver is moved, even when it is moved back to the previous location. 
5. 
Provide for the use of File Numbers greater than 9999.  Bytes 1, 2, and 3 in General Header Block #2 allow for a 
three byte, binary file number.  When the file number is greater than 9999, bytes 1 and 2 in the General Header 
Block #1 must be set to FFFF. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Page 9:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9         
6.  
Provide for Extended Channel Sets/Scan Types.  General Header Block #2 allows for a two byte, binary number of 
Channel Sets/Scan Types in bytes 4 and 5.  When using the Extended Channel Sets/Scan Types, byte 29 of General 
Header #1 must be set to FF. 
7. 
Provide for additional Extended and External Header blocks.  General Header Block #2 bytes 6 and 7 (for Extended 
Header blocks) and Bytes 8 and 9 (for External Header blocks) allow the use of a two byte, binary number to allow 
more than 99 blocks.  When using these capabilities, General Header Block #1 byte 31 (for extended) and byte 32 
(for external) must be set to FF. 
8. 
Provide a mechanism for recording additional information about vibrator sources.  Byte 15 of the General Header 
Block #N indicates the signal used to control vibrator phase.  Byte 16 indicates the type of vibrator (P, Shear, 
Marine).  Bytes 28 and 29 contain the phase angle between the pilot and the phase feedback signal. 
The additional vibrator information may be recorded for multiple sets of sources by using additional General Header 
blocks. 
9. 
Provide for larger number of samples per trace.  Using bytes 8, 9, and 10 of the Trace Header Extension.  
10. 
Provide provisions for using 1/2" square tape cartridges.  (ANSI X3.180 1989). 
11. 
Allow recording data in IEEE and other new formats. 
Additional Valid Format Codes for bytes 3 & 4 of the General Header are: 
0036 
24 bit 2's compliment integer multiplexed 
0038 
32 bit 2's compliment integer multiplexed 
0058 
32 bit IEEE multiplexed 
8036 
24 bit 2's compliment integer demultiplexed 
8038 
32 bit 2's compliment integer demultiplexed 
8058 
32 bit IEEE demultiplexed 
    The IEEE format is fully documented in the IEEE standard,  
    "ANSI/IEEE Std 754 - l985", available from the IEEE. 
    The IEEE format is summarized as follows:

The value (v) of a floating-point number represented in this format is determined as follows: 
if e = 255 & f ¹ 0. .v = NaN 
Not-a-Number  (see Note 2) 
if e = 255 & f = 0. .v = (-1)s *∞

if e = 0 & f ¹ 0. . .v = (-1)s *2e-126 *(0.f) 
Denormalized  
if e = 0 & f = O. . .v = (-1)s *0 
± zero 
where  
 e = binary value of all C's (exponent) 
 f = binary value of all Q's (fraction) 
NOTES:   1. 
Bit 7 of byte 4 must be zero to guarantee uniqueness of the start of scan in the Multiplexed 
format (0058).  It may be non zero in the demultiplexed format (8058). 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Page 10:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10         
     2. 
A Not-a-Number (NaN) is interpreted as an invalid number.  All other numbers are valid and 
interpreted as described above. 
12. 
Allow for the use of blocked records. Allow blocked demultiplexed data (integral number of traces in a block). 
Headers will not be blocked.  All records in a block will be the same size. Not all blocks will be the same size.  
Byte 20 in the general header (B1 = 1) will indicate blocked data. Blocks will be limited to 128 kilobytes. All 
traces in a block are in the same Channel Set. 
13. 
Added the effective stack order (unsigned binary), in byte 30 in the Channel Set descriptor.  Set to 0 if the trace 
data was intentionally set to real 0. Set to 1 if no stack. Set to the effective stack order if the data is the result of 
stacked data (with or without processing). 
14. 
Improved definition of undefined fields.  All undefined fields will be specified as: "This field is undefined by this 
format". 
15.  
Added provisions for a Trace Edit byte (byte 10 of Demux Trace Header) to indicate traces zeroed for roll-on or 
roll-off and to indicate deliberately zeroed traces. 
TR=0 No edit of this trace, 
TR=1 Trace part of dead channels for roll-on or roll-off spread; trace intentionally zeroed. 
TR=2 Trace intentionally zeroed. 
16. 
Increased precision of MP factor, using byte 7 of the Channel Set descriptor. 
17.  
 Since modern seismic vessels record more than one streamer at a time, a standard convention is required to 
identify which streamer recorded each channel of data. The Channel Set Descriptors are updated to handle this 
task.  The definition of a channel set is expanded to include the following rules.  A channel set is a group of 
channels that: 
a) 
Use identical recording parameters.  This includes the same record length and sample interval. 
b) 
Use identical processing parameters, including the same filter selection and array forming parameters.  A 
field has been added to Channel Set Descriptor byte 32 to describe any array forming applied to data in 
that channel set.   
c) 
Originates from the same streamer cable for marine data.  The streamer cable number for each channel 
set has been added to Channel Set Descriptor byte 31. 
d) 
Consists of channels with the same group spacing.  For example, if one steamer has short group spacing 
close to the boat and longer groups spacing at long offsets, the data from that streamer would be recorded 
as two channel sets. 
In addition, the first channel in each channel set will start with Trace number one. 
18. 
Correct the MP factor calculation (refer to Appendix E7 in the SEG-D recording format description. 
MP CALCULATION 
The calculation of MP for a data recording method is given by one of the following equations: 
(1) 
MP = FS - PA - Cmax; for binary exponents, 
(2) 
MP = FS - PA - 2 x Cmax; for quaternary exponents, 
(3) 
MP = FS - PA - 4 x Cmax; for hexadecimal exponents (except the 4 byte excess 64 method), 
(4)  
 MP = FS - PA - 4 (Cmax - 64); for excess 64 hexadecimal exponents and for 4 byte IEEE exponents, 
where 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Page 11:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11         
2FS = Converter full scale (millivolts), 
2PA = Minimum system gain, 
and 
Cmax = maximum value of the data exponent, 
Cmax = 15 for binary exponents, 
7 for quaternary exponents, 
3 for hexadecimal exponents except excess 64; and 
64 for excess 64 exponents and for 4 byte IEEE exponents. 
19. 
Added the option for using record lengths in millisecond increments (rather than the previous 0.5 second 
increments).  The Extended Record Length is the record length, in unsigned binary milliseconds, and is recorded 
in bytes 15-17 in General Header Block #2.  If this option is used, Record Length (R), in the General Header 
Block #1, bytes 26, 27 must be set to FFF.

3.0 Format Overview 
The SEG-D, Rev 2.x formats treats data going to tape as a byte stream. Figure 1 illustrates a typical record structure. 
A tape, or other media to be used for SEG-D, Rev 2.x recording may be partitioned.  Each partition, or each tape if not 
partitioned, constitutes one storage unit.  The storage unit label shall consist of the first 128 bytes of the first user-
writable tape record in the first user-writable physical block and may, optionally, be followed by a File Mark. No File 
Mark shall be written before the storage unit label. 
Each SEG-D Rev 2.x tape must begin with a tape label, as detailed in section 4. Following the tape label, each seismic 
record is recorded in demultiplexed format. SEG-D, Rev 2.x does not support multiplexed data records. 
When blocked data is being recorded, all of the headers may be included in the same block with the initial channel set.  
Each channel set may be split across block boundaries. Block boundaries may not occur within a trace. 
Data may be recorded in large blocks to maximize the transfer rates with high density tape systems. 3 types of device 
structures are supported: 
A) Variable block length devices. 
Every shot record must be aligned on a block boundary (i.e. each block will contain data from only one shot 
record).  Multiple channel sets may be included in each block. When the data to be recorded in a block contains 
less than the maximum number of bytes in the block, there will be no padding characters to fill the block. 
Storage Unit Structure in field 3 in Storage Unit Label must contain the text “RECORD” 
B) Byte stream devices 
There is no concept of a block, even though there is a hidden underlying physical block structure. Within each 
file, one or more shot records are written consecutively without any gap. 
Storage Unit Structure in field 3 in Storage Unit Label must contain the text “RECORD” 
C) Fixed block length devices 
Every shot record must be aligned on a block boundary (i.e. each block will contain data from only one shot 
record).  Multiple channel sets may be included in each block. Typically the last block in a shot record will 
contain less data than the block size, the remaining part of this block will be padded with characters without any 
information. 
Storage Unit Structure in field 3 in Storage Unit Label must contain the text “FIXREC” and the block size is 
found in field 5 in Storage Unit Label. 
Note:  Structure A can be mapped to a file directly but one can not re-generate the same interblock gaps (if 
present) and File Marks from data stored on a file. Structure B and C can be mapped to a file directly and the 
structure can be re-generated apart from the original position of the File Marks. 
The SEG-D, Rev 2.x format treats data going to tape as a byte stream.  File Marks are not required to separate shot 
records, however File Marks may be included in between shot records where appropriate to ease error recovery and/or to 
provide logical partitioning of the data.  If used, File Marks may only be recorded at shot record boundaries.  For field 
tapes, File Marks should be written as frequently as possible, preferably for every shot.  If data is staged on disk, many 
shots can be stored in each file.  When SEG-D, Rev 2.x data is recorded on tape, an EOD mark must be recorded after 
that last valid record and prior to the end of tape.

If the tape media supports multiple partitions, SEG-D data may be written to any of the partitions of the tape, each 
beginning with a Storage Unit Label.  Data from one partition can not “run-over” into a subsequent partition, each 
partition must be capable of being decoded in isolation. 
On one tape, it is allowed to mix partitions containing SEG-D data with partitions containing non SEG-D formatted 
information.

4.0 SEG-D, Rev 2.1 Tape Label 
The first 128 bytes of data on a Rev 2.1 (and Rev 2.0) tape must consist of ASCII characters and will constitute a 
storage unit label. This label is very similar to the RP-66 storage unit label. The label format is summarized in the table 
below. 
If the tape media supports multiple partitions, SEG-D data may be written to any of the partitions of the tape, each 
beginning with a Storage Unit Label.  Data from one partition can not “run-over” into a subsequent partition, each 
partition must be capable of being decoded in isolation. 
On one tape, it is allowed to mix partitions containing SEG-D data with partitions containing non SEG-D formatted 
information.

Field 1 
The Storage Unit Sequence Number is an integer in the range 1 to 9999 that indicates the order in which 
the current storage unit occurs in the storage set. The first storage unit of a storage set has sequence number 
1, the second 2, and so on. This number is represented using the characters 0 to 9, right justified with leading 
blanks if needed to fill out the field (No leading zeros). The rightmost character is in byte 4 of the label. This 
field is optional. If not used, it must be blank (filled with blank characters). This implies that this is the only 
storage unit within the storage set.  Separate Storage Sets should be used for different data types. 
Field 2 
The SEG-D Revision field indicates which revision of SEG-D was used to record the data on this tape.  
SD2.1 indicates that the data was recorded using SEG-D, Revision 2.1 (SD2.0 in previous revision)- This 
field is required. 
Field 3 
Storage Unit Structure is a name indicating the record structure of the storage unit. This name is left 
justified with trailing blanks if needed to fill out the field. The leftmost character is in byte 10 of the label. 
For SEG-D, Rev 2.1 and 2.0 tapes, this field must contain “RECORD” or “FIXREC”.  This field is required. 
“RECORD” -- Records may be of variable length, ranging up to the Blocksize length specified in the 
maximum Block size field of the storage unit label (if not zero). If the maximum Block size specified is zero, 
then records may be of any length. 
“FIXREC” -- All records in the storage unit have the same length, namely that specified in the maximum 
Block size field of the storage unit label.  Although all storage units in the same storage set must have a 
FIXREC structure, the maximum record length may be different in different storage units.  When the 
FIXREC option is used, then the maximum record length field shall not be 0 (zero). 
Field 4 
Binding edition is the character B in byte 16 of the label followed by a positive integer in the range 1 to 999 
(no leading zeros), left justified with trailing blanks if needed to fill out the field. The integer value 
corresponds to the edition of the Part 3 of the API, RP66 standard used to describe the physical binding of 
the logical format to the storage unit. This field is required. 
Field 5 
Maximum Block Size is an integer in the range of 0 to 4,294,967,295 (232-1), indicating the maximum 
block length for the storage unit, or 0 (zero) if undeclared. This number is represented using the characters 0 
to 9, right justified, with leading blanks if necessary to fill out the field (no leading zeros). The rightmost 
character is byte 29 of the label. A valid value or 0 (zero) must be recorded. 
Field 6 
Producer organization code is an integer in the range of 0 to 4,294,967,295 (232-1) indicating the 
organization code of the storage unit producer. This number is represented using the characters 0 to 9, right 
justified, with leading blanks if necessary to fill out the field (NO leading zeros). The rightmost character is 
byte 39 of the label. This field may be empty, i.e. may contain all blanks, in which case no storage unit 
producer is specified (e.g. same as RP-66 V2).

Field 7 
Creation date is the earliest date that any current information was recorded on the storage unit. The date is 
represented in the form dd-MMM-yyyy, where yyyy is the year (e.g. 1996), MMM is one of (JAN, FEB, 
MAR, APR, MAY, JUN, JUL, AUG, SEP, OCT, NOV, DEC), and dd is the day of the month in the range 1 
to 31. Days 1 to 9 may have one leading blank. The separator is a hyphen (code 4510).  This field is 
required. 
Field 8 
Serial number is an ID used to distinguish the storage unit from other storage units in an archive of an 
enterprise. The specification and management of serial numbers is delegated to organizations using this 
standard. If an external label is used the name/number must be a subset of the serial number or the External 
Label Name in Field 10, and must occupy the rightmost characters in the serial number (or External Label 
Name).  This field is required. 
Field 9 
This field is reserved and should be recorded as all blanks (code 3210). 
Field 10 
The Storage set identifier is a descriptive name for the storage set. Every storage unit in the same storage 
set shall have the same value for the user defined portion of the storage set identifier in its storage unit 
label. Included in the Storage Set Identifier is the External Label Name. The characters in this field are 
right justified with leading blank characters as required. If the tape does not have a physical label, then this 
field must be blank. A physical label is optional, but if it exists, then this field is required only if the external 
label is different from the lower 6 characters of the Serial Number in field 8. The next field in the Storage set 
identifier is the Recording Entity Name. This must contain the crew number or name, or some other unique 
identifier which will differentiate the recording entity which recorded this data from any other recording 
entity within the organization (as included in field 6). The 24 bytes may by any alphanumeric characters. If 
multiple recording systems are used on a vessel or crew, then data recorded on each system must be clearly 
distinguished. For example, an ABC Geophysical crew (party 13), on the M/V Gopher, recording data on 
two Zip 6000 recording systems might have a Recording Entity Name on tapes recording on the first 
recording system of: 
ABC, Gopher, P13, Zip#1 
On the second system, the Recording Entity Name might be: 
ABC, Gopher, P13, Zip#2 
The Recording Entity Name field is required. 
USER DEFINED 
The next 14 bytes in this field may contain any other user input information. The only restriction is that the data 
must be in ASCII. 
Max Number of shot records per field record.  Field Records are data between File Marks (10 bytes). 
It is not acceptable to use an ANSI label (or any other label or data) prior to the Storage Unit Label. 
An external, physical label is not required.

5.0 Header blocks 
The headers are blocks of data prior to the seismic data, which contain auxiliary information about the seismic data, the 
acquisition parameters, acquisition geometry, plus user defined information. The header block includes at least two 
General Headers, one or more Scan Type headers, and optional Extended and External headers. Trace Headers are 
included in conjunction with each seismic data trace. Sections 7 and 8 include detailed information about the content of 
each type header. 
In addition to header blocks which are recorded prior to the seismic data traces, an optional General Trailer is allowed 
following the seismic data. This allows recording other auxiliary information which is not available at the beginning of 
the record. Sections 7 & 8 include detailed description of the allowed fields of the General Trailer. 
5.1 General Headers (General Header #1 and #2 are required) 
General Header #1 is 32 bytes long and contains information similar to SEG A, B, C, and the original SEG-D headers. 
Abbreviations are as close as possible to those used in previous formats. 
SEG-D, Rev 2.1 and 2.0 requires the use of General Header #1 and General Header #2 (as was also required in SEG-D, 
Rev 1). General Header #2 provides locations to record the source location, and other parameters, for each record. 
Source positions are defined by a source line number (three bytes integer and two bytes fraction), a source point number 
(three bytes integer and two bytes fraction), and a source point index (one byte). This index allows several locations for 
the source in the grid, the original value is 1 and that value is incremented by 1 every time the source is moved, even 
when it is moved back to a previous location. More General header block extensions may be added to record parameters 
for additional sources. 
General Header blocks #3 (optional) and higher provide locations to record information about vibrator sources. Byte 15 
of the general header block #N (N>2) indicates the signal used to control vibrator phase. Byte 16 indicates the type of 
vibrator. Bytes 28 and 29 contain the phase angle between the pilot and the phase feedback signal.  
Bytes 1,2,3 in general header block #2 allow for a three byte, binary file number. When the file number is greater than 
9999, bytes 1 and 2 in the general header block #1 must be set to FFFF.  
General header block #2 also allows for a two byte, binary number of channel sets/scan types in bytes 4 and 5. When 
using the extended channel sets/scan types, byte 29 of the general header #1 must be set to FF. 
Additional blocks may be added as needed by the manufacturer or user. 
5.2 Scan Type Headers (required) 
The Scan Type header is used to describe the information of the recorded channels (filters, sample intervals, sample 
skew, etc.). The Scan Type header is composed of one or more channel set descriptors followed by skew information. 
The channel set descriptors must appear in the same order as their respective channel sets will appear within a base scan 
interval. A channel set, which is part of a scan type, is defined as a group of channels all recorded with identical 
recording parameters. One or more channel sets can be recorded concurrently within one scan type. In addition, there 
can be multiple scan types to permit dynamic scan type changes during the record (e.g., 12 channels at 1/2 ms switched 
at about 1 second to 48 channels at 2 ms). Where there are dynamic changes, scan type header 1 describes the first part 
of the record, scan type header 2 the second part, etc. Within the scan type header, each channel set descriptor is 
composed of a 32 byte field, and up to 99 channel set descriptors may be present. In addition, up to 99 scan type headers 
may be utilized in a record. 
Following the channel set descriptors of a scan type are a number of 32 byte fields (SK, specified in byte 30 of the 
general header #1) that specify sample skew. Sample skew (SS) is recorded in a single byte for each sample of each 
subscan of each channel set, in the same order as the samples are recorded in the scan. Each byte represents a fractional 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Page 22:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
22         
part of the base scan interval (Byte 23 of general header #1). The resolution is 1/256 of this interval. For instance, if the 
base scan interval is 2 msec, the least significant bit in the sample skew byte is 1/256 of 2 msec or 7.8125 microseconds. 
A channel set is a group of channels that: 
a) 
Use identical recording parameters. This includes the same record length and sample interval. 
b) 
Use identical processing parameters, including the same filter selection and array forming parameters. 
c) 
Originates from the same streamer cable for marine data. The streamer cable number for each channel set is 
included in the channel set descriptor byte 31. 
d)  
Consists of channels with the same group spacing. For example, if one streamer has short group spacing close to 
the boat and longer group spacing at long offsets, the data from the streamer would be recorded as two channel 
sets.  The first channel in each channel set will start with trace number one. 
The following is a list of ground rules for the scan type header: 
1. 
The order in which channel sets are described in the header will be the same as the order in which the data are 
recorded for each channel set. 
2. 
In a scan type header containing multiple channel set descriptors with different sample intervals, each channel set 
descriptor will appear only once in each scan type header. Within the data block, however, shorter sampling 
interval data are recorded more frequently. 
3. 
In the case of multiple scan type records, such as the dynamically switched sampling interval case, each scan type 
will contain the same number of channel sets. Any unused channel sets needed in a scan type must be so indicated 
by setting bytes 9 and 10 (channels per channel set) to zero in the channel set descriptor. 
4. 
In multiple scan type records, the number of bytes per base scan interval must remain a constant for all scan types 
recorded. 
5. 
Channel set order within a scan type should be: auxiliary channels, long sampling interval channels, short 
sampling interval channels. All channel sets of the same sampling interval should be contiguous. 
6. 
Channels within the same Channel Set must now have the same number of Trace Header Extensions. Since all 
traces within a Channel Set will contain the same number of Trace Header Extensions, the number of Trace 
Header Extensions will be indicated in the Channel Set Descriptor. The previously unused nibble of Byte 29 in 
the Channel Set Descriptor will now be defined to be a 4 bit binary parameter that defines the number of Trace 
Header Extensions for that Channel Set. Byte 29 of the Channel Set descriptor will now be: 
0 
1 
2 
3

As a result of this limitation the Trace Header Extension field in Byte 11 of the Trace Header is also redefined as a 4 
bit value limited to a maximum of 15 Trace Header Extensions.  
7. The length of each trace within a Channel Set is restricted to be the same value. This limitation and the restricting 
the number of Trace Header Extensions to the same number within a Channel Set will result in each trace within a 
Channel Set being recorded with the same number of bytes. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Page 23:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
23         
5.3 Trace Header (required) 
The trace header length is 20 bytes and is an identifier that precedes each channel’s data. The trace header and the trace 
data are recorded as one block of data. A trace is restricted to one channel of data from one channel set of one scan type. 
Some of the information in the trace header is taken directly from the general header and the scan type header. 
Bytes 7, 8, and 9 comprise the timing word that would accompany the first sample if these data were written in 
multiplex format. To obtain the exact sample time, the actual sample skew time (Byte 11 multiplied by the base scan 
interval) must be added to the time recorded in Bytes 7, 8, and 9. 
The timing word is in milliseconds and has the following bit weight assignments:

The timing word LSB (2-8) is equal to 1/256 msec, and the MSB (215) is equal to 32,768 msec. The timing word for each 
scan is equal to the elapsed time from zero time to the start of that scan. Timing words of from 0 to 65,535.9961 msec 
are codable.  For longer recordings the timing word may overflow to zero and then continue. 
The first scan of data has typically started with timing word zero. However, this is not a requirement. In a sampling 
system, it is not always practical to resynchronize the system even though most seismic data acquisition systems have to 
date.  Possible reasons for not wanting to resynchronize could be digital filtering, communication restrictions, etc. 
Whether the system is resynchronized or not, the timing word will contain the time from the energy source event to the 
start of scan of interest. For example, assume the sampling interval is 2 msec, the system does not resynchronize, and 
the energy source event occurs 1 + 9/256 msec before the next normal start of scan. The timing word values would be: 
First timing word 
0 + 1 + 9/256 msec 
Second   
2 + 1 + 9/256 msec 
Third 
4 + 1 + 9/256 msec 
Fourth  
6 + 1 + 9/256 msec 
… 
… 
One-thousandth timing word 
1998 + 1 + 9/256 msec 
Byte 11 contains sample skew of the first sample of this trace. This is identical to the first byte of sample skew for this 
channel in the scan type header. 
Bytes 13, 14, 15 are included as an integrity check on time break. They comprise the timing word of the scan in which 
TWI changed to a one. Thus, it represents the time from the time break to the end of the time break window. Random 
variations in this time indicate a problem in the fire control system. The presence of a value less than the base scan 
interval indicates that time break was not detected and recording commenced at the end of the time break window. 
A trace header extension block may be added to include the receiver location for that trace. Receiver locations are 
defined by a receiver line number (three integer bytes and two fraction bytes), a receiver point number (three bytes 
integer and two bytes fraction) and a receiver point index (one byte). This index allows for defining the receiver group 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Page 24:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
24         
in the grid, the original value is 1 and that value is incremented by 1 every time the receiver is moved, even when it is 
moved back to the previous location. The Sensor type (vertical geophone, hydrophone, etc.) may be indicated in Byte 
21.  
Additional trace header blocks may be added as needed by the manufacturer or user. The maximum number of Trace 
Header Extensions is limited to 15. 
A larger number of samples per trace may be recorded using bytes 8, 9, and 10 of the trace header extension.  
5.4 Extended Header (optional) 
The extended header provides additional areas to be used by equipment manufacturers to interface directly with their 
equipment. Since the nature of this data will depend heavily on the equipment and processes being applied, it will be the 
responsibility of the equipment manufacturer to establish a format and document this area. Byte 31 of the general header 
#1 contains the number of 32 byte fields in the extended header. If more than 99 extended header blocks are used, then 
General Header Block #1, Byte 31 is set to FF and Bytes 6 and 7 in the General Header Block #2 indicate the number of 
Extended Header Blocks. 
5.5 External Header (optional) 
The external header provides a means of recording special user desired information in the header block. This data 
format will be defined and documented by the end user. The means of putting this information into the header has 
usually been provided by the equipment manufacturer. Byte 32 of the General Header Block #1 contains the number of 
32 byte fields in the external header. If more than 99 External header blocks are used, then General Header Block #1, 
Byte 32 is set to FF and Bytes 8 and 9 of General Header Block #2 indicates the number of External Header Blocks. 
5.6 Data Trailer (optional) 
Following the seismic data, a General Trailer may be recorded. This type header allows provisions for recording 
auxiliary system and navigation related data. The addition of the trailer will allow the accumulation of system faults, 
data QC information, real-time navigation position, and timing information on the same record and contiguous with, the 
shotpoint that it relates to. By recording this data after all of the other data, additional time is provided for collecting the 
data and transferring it to the recording system. The trailer blocks take the same general form as the Channel Set 
Descriptor. Byte 11 uses the “Channel Type Identification” set to 1100 to indicate a trailer block. Bytes 1 and 2 indicate 
the number of the general trailer block, with the first block numbered as 1. All other information in the trailer is optional 
and may be formatted as desired by the manufacturer or user. The number of general trailer blocks is indicated in bytes 
13 and 14 of the General Header Block #2.

6.0 Data Body 
Data is recorded as a byte stream in demultiplexed format. Preceding each trace of data is a trace header, and optionally 
trace header extensions. Each trace is a sequential set of points from one channel in one channel set. 
6.1 Data Recording Method 
To accommodate diverse recording needs, the data recording utilizes sample sizes of 8, 16, 20, and 32 bits. 
The data word is a number representation of the sign and magnitude of the instantaneous voltage presented to the 
system.  It is not an indication of how the hardware gain system functions.  The output of stepped gain systems may be 
represented as a binary mantissa and a binary exponent of base 2, 4, or 16 (binary, quaternary, or hexadecimal system). 
Following are descriptions of each of the data recording methods permitted.  The same number system is to be used on 
all samples in a record, including auxiliary and all other types of channels.  All recording methods are valid for 
multiplexed and demultiplexed records.  The 2 1/2 byte binary demultiplexed method uses the LSB whereas the 
comparable multiplexed method does not (in order to preserve the uniqueness of the start of scan code).

C=quaternary exponent.---This is a three bit positive binary exponent of 4 written as 4ccc where CCC can assume values 
from 0-7. 
Q1-4-fraction.---This is a 4 bit one’s complement binary fraction.  The radix point is to the left of the most significant bit 
(Q-1) with the MSB being defined as 2-1.  The fraction can have values from -1+2-4 to 1-2-4.  In order to guarantee the 
uniqueness of the start of scan, negative zero is invalid and must be converted to positive zero. 
Input signal = S.QQQQ x 4ccc x 2MP millivolts where 2MP is the value required to descale the data sample to the 
recording system input level.  MP is defined in Byte 8 of each channel set descriptor in the scan type header.

b In the demultiplexed format, Bytes 1 and 2 contain the exponents for the following four samples of the channel.  The 
sample numbers are relative and are only to denote position in the four sample subset. 
S=sign bit---(One = negative number). 
C=binary exponent.---This is a 4 bit positive binary exponent of 2 written as 2cccc where CCCC can assume values of 0-
15.  The four exponents are in sample order for the four samples starting with the first sample in bits 0-3 of Byte 1. 
Q1-15-fraction.---This is a 15 bit one’s complement binary fraction.  The radix point is to the left of the most significant 
bit (Q-1) with the MSB being defined as 2-1.  The sign and fraction can assume values from 1 -2-15 to -1 + 2-15.  Negative 
zero is invalid and must be converted to positive zero. 
Input signal=S.Q,QQQ,QQQQ,QQQQ,QQQ 2cccc x 2MP millivolts where 2MP is the value required to descale the data 
word to the recording system input level.  MP is defined in Byte 8 of each of the corresponding channel set descriptors 
in the scan type header. 
Note that in utilizing this data recording method, the number of samples per channel must be exactly divisible by 4 in 
order to preserve the data grouping of this method.

radix point is to the left of the most significant bit (Q-1) with the MSB being defined as 2-1.  The sign and fraction can 
assume values from (1 - 2-23 to -1 + 2-23).  It must always be written as a hexadecimal left justified number.  If this 
fraction is zero, the sign and exponent must also be zero (i.e., the entire word is zero.  Note that bit 7 of Byte 4 must be

Input signal = S.QQQQ,QQQQ,QQQQ,QQQQ,QQQQ,QQQ x 16(ccccccc-64) x 2MP millivolts where 2MP is the value 
required to descale the data sample to the recording system input level.  MP is defined in Byte 8 of each channel set 
descriptor in the scan type header.  This data recording method has more than sufficient rage to handle the dynamic 
range of a typical seismic system.  Thus, MP may not be needed to account for any scaling and may be recorded as zero.

6.2 MP Factor calculation 
The MP parameter is provided to allow the dimensionless numbers recorded on tape to be “descaled” back to the 
instantaneous sample values in millivolts at the system inputs.  MP is encoded in Byte 8 of each channel set descriptor 
in the scan type header.  It is a sign and magnitude binary exponent.  It can have any value between -31.75 and +31.75 
in increments of .25.  Beginning with SEG-D, Rev 1, the MP parameter is expanded to a two byte value between -
31.9990234375 and + 31.9990234375 in increments of .0009765625. 
In general, recording systems scale the input signal level in order to match the useful range of input levels to the gain-
ranging amplifier.  MP must account for all scaling (unless, as in the 4 byte hexadcimal case, the data recording method 
has sufficient range). 
The calculation of MP for a data recording method is given by one of the following equations: 
For floating point data: 
1. MP = FS - PA - Cmax 
For binary exponents. 
2. MP = FS - PA - 2 * Cmax 
For quaternary exponents. 
3. MP = FS - PA - 4 * Cmax 
For hexadecimal exponents (except for the four byte 
excess 64 method). 
4. MP = FS - PA - 4* (Cmax-64) 
For excess 64 hexadecimal exponents and for four byte IEEE 
exponents. 
Where: 
2FS = Converter full scale (millivolts), 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Page 30:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
30         
2PA = Minimum system gain, 
Cmax = maximum value of the data exponent; 
Cmax =  
15 for binary exponents 
7 quaternary exponents, 
3 for hexadecimal exponents, except excess 64, 
64 for excess 64 exponents and for 4 byte IEEE exponents, and the output  
of the analog-to-digital converter is written as the fractional portion of the data value. 
For integer data: 
1. MP = FS - PA - IS; 
Where: 
2FS = Converter full scale (millivolts), 
2PA = Minimum system gain, 
2IS-1 = Integer number system positive full scale, and 
the output of the analog-to-digital converter is written as an integer. 
Input signal = S III, IIII, IIII, IIII, IIII, IIII, IIII, IIII x 2MP millivolts. 
The term “minimum system gain” includes preamplifier gain and the minimum floating point amplifier gain.  For 
example, one system may use a preamplifier gain of 256 and a minimum floating point amplifier gain of one.  The 
minimum system gain is 256 x 1 = 28, so PA = 8.  Another system may use a preamplifier gain of 320 and a minimum 
floating point amplifier gain of 0.8.  In this case, the minimum system gain is 320 x 0.8 = 256 or 28.  Again PA = 8. 
PA may also account for any amplification needed to accommodate an analog to digital converter with a full scale value 
that is not a power of 2 in millivolts.  For example, a 10 V (10,000 mV) converter may be preceded by an amplifier with 
a gain of 1.221 (10,000/8,192).  This gain may be accounted for in PA.  Alternatively, it could be considered part of the 
converter, making it appear to have a binary full scale. 
Justifications for the Equations 
The output of the analog-to-digital converter is written as the fractional portion of the data value.  This is equivalent to 
dividing the value by the full scale of the converter.  In order to compensate for this, the data value recorded on tape 
must be multiplied by the full scale value of the converter (2FS).  Thus FS appears in equations (1)-(4) with a positive 
sign. 
The input signal was multiplied by the minimum system gain (2PA) which, as mentioned, includes any preamplification 
gain, minimum floating point amplifier gain, or analog-to-digital converter adjustment gain.  The data recorded on tape 
must be divided by this minimum system gain; thus, PA appears in the equations with a negative sign. 
Large input signals converted at minimum floating point amplifier gain are written on tape with the  maximum exponent 
for the data recording method used.  Likewise, small signals converted at full gain are written with the maximum 
exponent.  The data as written have been multiplied by the exponent base  raised to Cmax (or Cmax -64 in the excess 64 
case).  Thus Cmax appears in the equations with a negative sign.  MP is a power of 2 so the quaternary and hexadecimal 
Cmax values are multiplied by 2 and 4, respectively (4c = 22c and 16c = 24c).

SCAN TYPE HEADER (channel set descriptor) 
The scan type header is determined by the system configuration and consists of one or more channel set descriptors each 
of 32 bytes followed by a series of 32 byte sample skew fields.  A channel set is defined as a group of channels 
operating with the same set of parameters and being sampled as part of a scan of data.  A scan type header can be 
composed of from 1 to 99 channel set descriptors.  If dynamic parameter changes are required during the recording, 
additional scan type headers must be added, each containing the channel set descriptors necessary to define the new 
parameters.  Each scan type header must have the same number of channel set descriptors (see Appendix E.4).

DESCRIPTION 
BYTE 
_____  
_____________ ____________________________________________________ 
1 
ST1, ST2 
These two digits (1-99) identify the number of the scan type header to be 
described by the subsequent bytes.  The first scan type header is 1 and the last 
scan type header number is the same value as Byte 28 (ST/R) of the General 
Header Block #1.  If a scan type header contains more than one channel set 
descriptor, the scan type header number will be repeated in each of its channel 
set descriptors.  If the system does not have dynamic parameter changes during 
the record, such as switched sampling intervals, there will only be one scan 
type  header required. 
2 
CN1, CN2 
These two digits (1-99) identify the channel set to be described in the next 30 
bytes within this scan type header.  The first channel set is "1" and the last 
channel set number is the same number as Byte 29 (CS) of the General Header 
Block #1.  If the scan actually contains fewer channel sets than CS, then 
dummy channel set descriptors are included as specified in Byte 29 of General 
Header Block #1.  Set to FF when using Channel Sets beyond 99. 
3 - 4 
TF16 thru TF9 
TF8  thru TF1 
Channel set starting time.  This is a binary number where TF1 = 
binary number msec (2-msec increments).  This number identifies the timing word of the 
first scan of data in  this channel set.  In a single scan type record, this would 
typically be recorded as a zero (an exception might be deep water recording).  
In multiple scan type records, this number represents the starting time, in 
milliseconds, of the channel set. Start times from 0 to 131,070 msec (in  
2-msec increments) can be recorded. 
5 - 6 
TE16 thru TE9 
TE8  thru TE1 
Channel set end time.  This is a binary number where TE1 = binary number 
milliseconds (2 millisecond increments).  These two bytes represent the record 
end time of the channel set in milliseconds. TE may be used to allow the 
termination of a particular channel set shorter than other channel sets within its 
scan type.  In a single scan type record, Bytes 5 and 6 would be the length of 
the record.  End times up to 131,070 msec (in 2-msec increments) can be 
recorded. 
7 
MP-3, MP-10 
Optional byte which extends the resolution available for MP factor.  
8 
MPS, MP4 thru MP-2 
This sign magnitude binary number is the exponent of the base 2 
multiplier to be used to descale the data on tape to obtain input voltage in 
millivolts.  The radix point is between MP0 and MP-1.  This multiplier has a 
range of 231.75 to 2-31.75.  (See Appendix E7 of the SEG-D Standard.)

GENERAL TRAILER 
This type header allows provisions for recording auxiliary seismic system and real-time navigation related data in the 
trailer.  The trailer is optional and typically follows all other recorded data. 
The addition of the trailer will allow the accumulation of system faults, data QC information, and real-time navigation 
position and timing information on the same tape, and contiguous with, the shotpoint that it relates to.  By recording this 
data after all of the other data, additional time is provided for collecting the data and transferring it to the recording 
system. 
The Trailer blocks take the same general form as the Channel Set Descriptor.  Byte 11 uses the "Channel Type 
Identification" set to 1100 to indicate a Trailer block. 
Bytes 1 and 2 indicate the number of the General Trailer block, with the first block numbered as 1.

Appendix B: Glossary 
Attribute - A named item of information  or data pertaining to an object. 
Base scan interval - The time between timing words.  A base scan interval usually contains one scan but under 
some conditions may contain multiple subscans. 
Beginning of tape mark (BOT) - An indelible mark (e.g., reflector) near the beginning of the tape that indicates 
the start of the region in which recorded data is permitted. 
Block - The data between gaps on tape. 
Channel set - One or more channels sampled at the same sampling interval and containing the same filter, fixed 
gain, and other fixed parameter information. 
Channel set descriptor - A unit of the scan type header describing the parameters of a channel set. 
Data recording method - The arrangement of bits to represent samples on tape. 
End of data flag (EOD) - A special record or condition on the tape used to indicate the end of data on the tape. 
End of file mark (EOF) - A special record or condition on the tape that indicates the end of a tape file.  Also 
called File Mark. 
End of tape warning (ETW) - An indelible mark (e.g., reflector), located a required minimum distance from the 
physical end of the tape that serves as a warning. 
File - All data recorded from a single energy impluse or sweep.  It may also be the sum of a number of energy 
impluses or sweeps.  Literally, it is all of the blocks between file marks. 
Filemark - A special record or state of a media index that indicates the end of a physical file. 
Format Data - recording method combined with a multiplexed/demultiplexed indicator (see general header Bytes 
3 and 4). 
General header - The first header in the header block.  It contains information common to the entire record. 
Index byte - The byte number of some particular parameter within the general or scan type header. 
Organization code - A number assigned by the Energistics to an organization that identifies the organization and 
represents schemas and dictionaries defined and administered by the organization. 
Packed BCD - Binary coded decimal digits represented by four data bits. 
Partition - An independent recording area resulting from physical formatting of the media that can be mounted as 
though it were a single volume. 
Physical blocks (on tape) - A collection of contiguous bytes recorded as a unit on a longitudinal tape or a track 
set on helical scan tape.  Physical blocks on longitudinal tape are separated by interblock gaps. 
Sample skew - The fraction of the base scan interval between the timing word and the actual time the sample was 
taken in a base scan interval (not related to position on tape). 
Sampling interval - The interval between readings such as the time between successive samples of a digital 
seismic trace. 
Scan - One complete sequence of events, such as sampling all channels.  Data recorded during a base scan 
interval. 
Scan interval - The interval between readings of all samples contained in a scan type. 
Scan type - One complete set of channel sets which make up a scan.  A seismic record contains multiple scans, 
and may or may not contain more than one scan type. 
Scan type header - A header containing one or more channel set descriptors and the skew information. 
Schema - A formalized description of the encoding of information defined by a logical model, typically in terms 
of a data model. 
Storage set - An ordered set of storage units, the position in the set is specified in the storage unit label. 
Storage unit - A logical volume of data containing on or more logical files. 
Subscan - A set of samples containing one sample for each channel in a channel set. 
Tape file - Is the data contained between two File Marks or between an File Mark at its beginning and an EOD at 
its end.  A typical implementation of EOD is an empty tape file, i.e., two consecutive File Marks. Some systems 
implement EOD as two or more (possibly many) File Marks. 
Tape record - A sequence of data bytes treated as a unit by the tape I/O subsystem.  The application provides the 
number of bytes in the tape record when writing and is returned the number  of bytes in the tape record when 
reading.  A tape record has an identifiable beginning on the tape, which need not be on the boundary of a physical 
block, and which is locatable by the tape I/O subsystem.

Time break window - Time interval in which time break is expected.  If time break does not occur by the end of 
the window, internal time break is generated. 
Trace - A record of one seismic channel within a scan type.  A collection of a sequential set of points from one 
seismic channel. 
Trace block - A block containing the data of one trace or a part of a trace with constant parameters.

Appendix C: API Producer Organization Code 
C.1 Scope 
Table 1 below contains a list of organization codes assigned by Energistics — formerly the 
Petrotechnical Open Standards Consortium  (POSC) — for use in API Recommended Practice 66. 
Several of the organization codes in this appendix are historical in nature and reflect the well 
log origins of API Recommended Practice 66. 
This specification was originally prepared by the Subcommittee on Standard Format for 
Digital Well data. In June 1996 it was designated a recommended practice by the 
American Petroleum Institute Exploration & Production Department's Executive 
Committee on Drilling and Production Practices. In June 1998 stewardship of the 
document was transferred from API to Petroleum Open Standards Consortium, relaunched 
in December 2006 as Energistics.  
C.2 Assignment of Organization Codes 
Organization codes are assigned by Energistics, which maintains the current list of codes.

The following is copied from 
http://www.posc.org/technical/data_exchange/RP66/V2/rp66v2.html 
This document, POSC RP66 V2, is a specification of Petrotechnical Open Standards Consortium.  
This specification is based on and is equivalent in content to the document Recommended Practices for 
Exploration and Production Data Digital Interchange: API RECOMMENDED PRACTICE 66, V2: Second 
Edition, June 1996 published by the American Petroleum Institute (API). The acronym RP66V2 is retained for 
historical reasons; Energistics does not designate specifications as "Recommended Practices".

E.3 Filter slope calculation 
Modern filters may not have a constant slope, so it is necessary to define this parameter.  The slope is defined as the 
asymptote of effective perfomance as it would be in a constant slope filter.  This slope is zero dB attenuation at the cut-
off frequency and a specific attenuation at the beginning of the stop band.  The chosen values are 40 dB for a low-cut 
filter and 60 dB for an anti-alias filter. 
Low-cut filter slope calculation.-- 
LS= 
40 
   =    
40 
   =    
     12.04 
log2fLCO/f40 
3.322 log10fLCO/f40 
log10fLCO/f40 
LS =   low-cut filter slope (channel set descriptor Bytes 19 and 20), 
f40  =   the frequency of 40 dB low-cut filter attenuation, 
fLCO  =   low-cut filter cut-off frequency ususally 6 or 12 dB attenuation. 
Alias-filter slope calculation.-- 
           AS = 
60 
   =

   =            18.06 
log2f60/fACO 
3.322 log10f60/fACO 
log10f60/fACO 
AS  =  alias filter slope (channel set descriptor Bytes 15 and 16) 
f60  =  the frequency of 60 dB alias-filter attenuation 
fACO  =  alias-filter cut-off frequency usually 3 or 6 dB attenuation 
The resultant slope in the above calculation is rounded to the nearest whole number and is written in the channel set 
descriptor.
